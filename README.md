Operating System Principles Assignment 2

You should be able to do a make all in the root folder to create all the executables and run them like normal.
Please run them normally, one at a time. Datafiles are data_0, data_1, etc...

I also made a bash script which helped me get all the data needed for the tables.
  chmod +x run_trials.sh
  ./run_trials.sh
I used this script while modifying the calculateTimes() function in processor.cpp to show one stat at a time
You must have a directory called ./results for this to work
So if you want to use the bash script to test values, comment out the cout lines you don't need.
